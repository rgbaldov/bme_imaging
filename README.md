# Bioimaging / BME Imaging Systems

This repository contains lecture materials, lab exercises, and resources for the course **Biomedical Imaging Systems**. The course emphasizes **image processing techniques** for medical images, with applications in CT, MRI, PET, Ultrasound, Microscopy, and Digital Pathology.  

---

## üìò Course Description
BME Imaging Systems introduces the fundamentals of medical imaging modalities and focuses on computational image processing methods for **enhancement, segmentation, reconstruction, and analysis**. Students will implement algorithms using Python (OpenCV, SimpleITK, scikit-image, PyTorch) and apply them to **real biomedical datasets**.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the principles of biomedical image acquisition and challenges.  
- Apply spatial and frequency domain image processing techniques.  
- Implement denoising, segmentation, and registration pipelines.  
- Extract features (radiomics) for diagnostic and predictive modeling.  
- Develop machine learning and deep learning models for medical images.
