## 1. Introduction
- Computed Tomography (CT) is an **advanced imaging modality** that uses X-rays and computer processing to create cross-sectional images of the body.  
- Provides more detailed information than conventional radiography.  
- Widely used in **diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring** across medicine.  

## 2. Basic Principles
- CT uses a **rotating X-ray source and detectors** to collect data from multiple angles.  
- The computer reconstructs these projections into **axial slices**.  
- Images can be reformatted into **coronal, sagittal, and 3D views**.  

## 3. CT System Components
1. **X-ray Tube** – produces X-rays.  
2. **Detectors** – capture transmitted X-rays.  
3. **Gantry** – rotating frame holding the tube and detectors.  
4. **Patient Table** – motorized, moves through the gantry.  
5. **Computer System** – processes signals into images.  

## 4. Types of CT Scans
- **Conventional CT** – sequential slice imaging.  
- **Spiral/Helical CT** – continuous scanning with patient moving through gantry.  
- **Multislice CT (MSCT)** – multiple detector rows for faster, high-resolution imaging.  
- **Dual-Energy CT** – uses two energy levels to improve tissue differentiation.  

## 5. Clinical Applications
- **Neurology**: Stroke detection, brain trauma, tumors.  
- **Cardiology**: Coronary artery imaging, calcium scoring.  
- **Pulmonology**: Lung cancer screening, pulmonary embolism.  
- **Oncology**: Tumor staging, treatment monitoring.  
- **Trauma**: Rapid assessment of internal injuries.  
- **Musculoskeletal**: Bone fractures, joint assessment.  

## 6. Advantages
- High-resolution, cross-sectional imaging.  
- Rapid scan times.  
- Excellent for bone, lung, and complex anatomy.  
- Useful in emergencies and trauma cases.  

## 7. Limitations & Risks
- **Radiation Exposure**: Higher than conventional X-rays.  
- **Contrast Risks**: Allergic reaction, nephrotoxicity.  
- **Cost**: More expensive than basic imaging.  

## 8. Image Reconstruction Techniques
- **Filtered Back Projection (FBP)** – fast, traditional method.  
- **Iterative Reconstruction (IR)** – reduces noise, lowers radiation dose.  
- **AI-Assisted Reconstruction** – enhances image quality and efficiency.  

## 9. Future Directions
- Integration with **AI and Machine Learning** for automated detection.  
- **Low-dose CT protocols** for safer imaging.  
- **Hybrid Imaging** (PET-CT, SPECT-CT).  
- Advancements in **spectral imaging** and photon-counting detectors.  

## 10. Summary
- CT is a **powerful diagnostic tool** that revolutionized medical imaging.  
- Provides **detailed anatomical and functional insights**.  
- Despite radiation risks, it remains essential in modern medicine.
