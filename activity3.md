## Objective
Create a Tkinter application that processes and displays your webcam video in four different modes.

## Requirements

### 1. Views to Implement
- **Original** (raw image/video feed)  
- **Grayscale**  
- **Face Detection**  
- **Hand Pose Estimation**

### 2. Display Options
- Display all four views **simultaneously** (e.g., in a grid layout), **or**  
- Provide buttons that let users switch between views individually.

### 3. User Interface Design
- Use Tkinter widgets (frames, labels, buttons, etc.) to organize the layout.  
- Make the interface **user-friendly, clean, and creative**.  
- Ensure labels or captions clearly indicate which view is being shown.

### 4. Functionality
- Implement real-time image/video processing.  
- Use OpenCV for grayscale conversion, face detection, and hand pose estimation (mediapipe).  

### 5. Creativity Bonus
- Add styling (colors, fonts, icons) to enhance the interface.  
- Provide extra features (e.g., pause/play, snapshot, save result).

### 6. Submission Format
- Use the same format from the first two previous exercises.
- Create/write your own 3 specific objectives.

## Deliverable
A working Tkinter app (Python script) that meets the above requirements.
